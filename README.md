# My Atom Setup

If you really want to know how I started with Atom (and vim to come), then step right up, you've come to the right place. This is a list of all the packages I use adn the things I've learned about them along the way. I aim on this being an exhaustive list, so it will be updated as I add to my FED workflow.

The main purpose of this guide is to provide a hub for me to remember what the heck I've added to my Atom setup and force me to learn how to use them.

The Atom package list is here: [List of Atom Packages](https://github.com/gocamille/my-atom-setup/blob/master/atom-plugins.md)

## Credits

This wouldn't be a living and breathing document without the incredible female FEDs I've learned from around Canada and the U.S. -- I have to thank @minamarkham for sharing her awesome configurations. I also encourage you to check out @elijahmanor for his article on recommended github atom packages.

## Installation

Please follow the links for each Atom package for installation instructions. Atom also has straightforward instructions on adding packages here: [Atom packages](https://atom.io/docs/v1.0.11/using-atom-atom-packages)
